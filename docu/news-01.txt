&lt;p&gt;The board of trustees, at its meeting in December, accepted the recommendations of President Ronald D. Liebowitz and the board’s educational affairs committee in promoting the four faculty members. Their promotions take effect July 1, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Ayako Bennette, &lt;/strong&gt;who earned a bachelor’s degree from Johns Hopkins University and both a master’s and Ph.D. from Harvard University, joined the history department in 2005. Bennette is an expert on 19th- and 20th-century German history, and her book “Fighting for the Soul of Germany: Catholics and Their Struggle for Inclusion in the Nation after 1871” is scheduled for release in May 2012 by the Harvard University Press. In recommending her for tenure, President Liebowitz said her teaching is “a model of clarity and rigor,” and her courses in European history “contribute to Holocaust studies, Jewish studies, and other priorities” in the Middlebury curriculum. The recipient of five Harvard University grants, Bennette has delivered presentations and published articles on gender, religion, politics and national identity in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John A. Maluccio&lt;/strong&gt; joined the economics department at Middlebury in 2005 after eight years as a fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute’s division for food consumption and nutrition. An alumnus of Amherst College, Maluccio did his graduate work at Yale University where he earned master of arts, master of philosophy and doctor of philosophy degrees. He has been a prolific writer, presenter and reviewer in the field of econometrics and on topics related to economic development, nutrition and disease in Latin America. Maluccio has been awarded grants by the National Science Foundation, the Fulbright Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. President Liebowitz said Maluccio’s scholarship aimed at “reducing poverty and malnutrition in developing nations” has made an “important contribution to international policy debates over economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his promotion,&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Miller-Lane&lt;/strong&gt; becomes the first tenured faculty member in the newly configured education studies program. After earning a bachelor’s degree in Middle Eastern and African history at Northwestern University in 1985, Miller-Lane worked as an instructor and administrator with the Close Up Foundation in Washington, D.C. Next, he served two years in the teacher education department at the College of The Marshall Islands (Micronesia), followed by six years as a high school social studies teacher in Bainbridge Island, Wash. He holds a master of education degree from George Washington University and a Ph.D. in education from University of Washington. President Liebowitz saluted Miller-Lane for “effectively articulating a philosophical and theoretical [framework]” for education studies, and for both “preparing secondary school teachers and reflecting on the pedagogy of liberal arts institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Schmitt&lt;/strong&gt;, whose research interests include combinatorics, graph theory and discrete mathematics, joined the faculty in 2005 after earning a bachelor’s degree from Providence College, a master’s from the University of Vermont and a Ph.D. at Emory University. In conjunction with a National Science Foundation Research Opportunity Award in 2009, Schmitt held a two-year visiting appointment at Carnegie Mellon University to pursue his work on the “Turán Problem for Graphs and Hypergraphs.” In recommending Schmitt for tenure, his mathematics department colleagues were impressed by his success in maintaining a high-level scholarly agenda, and President Liebowitz added, “Your approach to teaching not only develops mathematical skills, but encourages students to understand why those skills may be valuable in an array of professional opportunities.” Schmitt was the 2008 recipient of Middlebury’s Perkins Award for Excellence in Teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same board meeting, three Middlebury professors were promoted to the rank of full professor:&lt;strong&gt; Peter Nelson&lt;/strong&gt; (geography), &lt;strong&gt;Theodore Sasson&lt;/strong&gt; (international studies) and &lt;strong&gt;Frank Swenton &lt;/strong&gt;(mathematics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>New race course brings Rikert Nordic Center to another level</title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/293550</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/293553/large/co60-2-10-ski-019.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;399&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIDDLEBURY, Vt. ― One of the best kept secrets in cross-country skiing is now home to one of the finest race courses in the country. The Carroll and Jane Rikert Nordic Center, operated by Middlebury College and surrounded by the Green Mountains in Ripton, will start the ski season this year with a new five-kilometer trail that has been certified for competition at the highest level by skiing’s governing body, the &lt;em&gt;Fédération Internationale de Ski&lt;/em&gt; (FIS). This makes Rikert one of just a handful of ski areas in the country that feature such trails. The new course, designed by legendary trail developer John Morton, will allow Rikert to host major competitions, including the Nordic events at the 2013 NCAA Skiing Championships. Rikert is home to the Middlebury College Nordic ski team. Recreational skiers will also enjoy the top-rated course, as well as a completely renovated lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now spacious, open and filled with natural light, the lodge includes a ski shop and seating area warmed by a wood stove, a favorite feature that was retained in the new design. Soup and snacks are available for sale or skiers can bring their own lunch. The newly renovated lodge and its restroom meet ADA standards. According to &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../../../../newsroom/archive/2010/node/270258&quot;&gt;Mike Hussey&lt;/a&gt;, director of Rikert, he and his staff are planning to develop adaptive ski programs as a result, along with weekly recreational ski and snowshoe programs for adults and children. Last season, Rikert acquired all-new rental equipment ― both classic and skate skis ― and a brand new groomer to ensure that the trails are in excellent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rikert has always been a gem and during the last year, we’ve really ramped up our operation,” said Hussey. “With the new course, we can host any level of race now and offer master skiers a challenging experience. It also allows the Middlebury ski team to train on a world-class race course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the NCAA championships, Hussey plans to work on attracting other national and major regional events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new trail and the renovations signal that we are serious about making Rikert an appealing destination,” he said. “We want Nordic skiers from Vermont and throughout the northeast to visit Rikert and check out our improved facilities and incredibly beautiful setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer of the new course, John Morton, has designed numerous trails for private landowners, municipalities, schools, resorts and large competitive international events such as Biathlon World Cup races. A former head coach of men’s skiing at Dartmouth and a 1968 Middlebury graduate, Morton was an Olympic biathlete and coach, and was named to the United States Biathlon Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Vermont Ski Hall of Fame in 2011. Morton’s design at Rikert links 2.5 kilometers of existing trail to 2.5 kilometers of new trail. As what’s called a “homologated” course, it meets FIS standards regarding width, climb levels and total elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width:250px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Site preparation began earlier this year for the new 5K trail at Rikert Nordic Center.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hussey, the design process started a year ago. Rikert received its Act 250 permit from the state of Vermont on Sept. 27, 2011, and construction by several local businesses began the next day. Jeffersonville-based G.W. Tatro Construction excavated and graded the course. McAllister Timber Harvesting of Hardwick harvested the trees. Nop’s Metalworks of Middlebury widened an existing bridge and built several new ones that are part of the trail. Goodro Lumber of East Middlebury and r.k. Miles of Middlebury provided the timber for the bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new course is good news for tourism in the area,” said Hussey. “It also sets the Middlebury College Nordic ski team apart since Middlebury is one of only a few colleges in the country to operate its own Nordic center and now the only one with a course certified at the highest level by FIS,” said Hussey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rikert Nordic Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../../../../middlebury_google_custom_search/go/rikert&quot;&gt;Carroll and Jane Rikert Nordic Center&lt;/a&gt; is a cross-country ski and snowshoe area located at the Bread Loaf campus of Middlebury College in Ripton, Vt. Bordered by the Green Mountain National Forest, these woodlands provide unspoiled natural beauty near the top of the Green Mountain range. Just 12 miles east of Middlebury on Route 125 and one and one-half miles west of the &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../../../../about/facilities/snow_bowl&quot;&gt;Middlebury College Snow Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, a downhill ski area, Rikert offers 42 kilometers of prepared trails for every level of ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rental equipment includes classic skis, skate skis and snowshoes. Repairs and waxing rooms are also available. A full-time staff of professional ski instructors offers lessons on a private and group basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;– end –&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Middlebury establishes program in Cameroon </title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/291799</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/291798/large/cameroon.jpg&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; height=&quot;116&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIDDLEBURY, Vt. ― Middlebury College has established a new program in Cameroon, the newest C.V. Starr-Middlebury School Abroad and the first in sub-Saharan Africa. Located in the city of Yaoundé and affiliated with L’Université catholique d’Afrique centrale (UCAC), the program will begin offering classes in the fall of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curriculum is designed for high intermediate and advanced French language students. Middlebury will work with UCAC to organize courses for program participants in several disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Students are also expected to enroll in courses alongside Cameroonian students at the university, striking a balance between program and university offerings. All coursework will be conducted in French by local faculty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middlebury staff will identify local families who will host the 10-15 students per semester who are expected to enroll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students will adhere to the Middlebury College Language Pledge ― a promise to speak no language other than the one they are studying. According to Middlebury College Dean of International Programs Jeff Cason, if they learn one of the many local languages — there are about 240 ethnic groups with as many distinct languages and dialects — they may speak that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cason and others at Middlebury were drawn to Cameroon for several reasons. Along with its many ethnic groups, Cameroon, the second largest nation in central Africa, offers all the major climates and landscapes of the continent in one country, from beaches, deserts and grasslands to mountains and rainforests. “Among nations in Francophone Africa, Cameroon provides a great deal of cultural and ecological diversity,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As Cameroon’s economic and political capital, Yaoundé is an ideal place for immersion into Francophone African life,” added Cason. Yaoundé, with a population of 1.5 million, is the country’s second largest city after Douala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’ve been contemplating a program in sub-Saharan Africa for some time and our African studies faculty are strongly behind it,” said Middlebury College Vice President of Language Schools, Schools Abroad and Graduate Programs Michael Geisler. “UCAC, which has 4,000 students, is an excellent location since it has the best academic facilities of any university in Cameroon, as well as a strong faculty.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad have more than 50 years of experience in providing academically challenging immersion programs and, with the addition of the site in Cameroon, will operate programs in 38 cities and 16 countries. Students come from a wide range of academic fields and take courses in most disciplines, often alongside host-country students; intern or engage in volunteer work; and live with a family or local residents. At every juncture, students are encouraged to immerse themselves in the host culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more detailed information, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/sa/&quot;&gt;http://www.middlebury.edu/sa/&lt;/a&gt; or contact Middlebury College International Programs at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:internationalprograms@middlebury.edu&quot;&gt;internationalprograms@middlebury.edu&lt;/a&gt; or 802-443-5745.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Reaccreditation review team completes site visit</title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/291393</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/291392/large/neasc_logo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;131&quot; height=&quot;95&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIDDLEBURY, Vt.—The reaccreditation review team representing the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) presented a summary of its findings to an open meeting of Middlebury College students, faculty and staff in McCullough Social Space on Nov. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight members of the visiting team, all faculty members and administrators from colleges throughout the Northeast, presented their key findings after nearly a year of analysis that included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a review of Middlebury’s      100-plus-page &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../../../../offices/administration/planning/middaccreditation&quot;&gt;self-study      report&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visits by team members to      the Language Schools and Bread Loaf School of English this past summer;      the Monterey Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif.; C.V.      Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad sites in Spain; and, from Oct. 31-Nov. 2,      the Middlebury campus for meetings with members of the college community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opening remarks, the chair of the team, Lawrence S. Bacow, president emeritus of Tufts University, called Middlebury a “remarkable institution [with] amazing energy.” He was struck by the high level of commitment of the faculty and staff, and “the passion they bring to their work.” Excellence permeates the institution at every level, he said, adding that the visiting team was impressed by Middlebury’s tradition of innovation in higher education that goes back generations, a tradition that produced the Language Schools, the Schools Abroad and the Bread Loaf School of English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacow said the team was impressed that the college had survived the economic downturn that began in 2008 without sacrificing the core values of the institution and without layoffs, noting the transparency with which the administration had communicated about finances and staffing. He also pointed out that the college has continued to honor its traditions while embracing change, most notably in recent years with the acquisition of the Monterey Institute of International Studies and the creation of the for-profit venture, Middlebury Interactive Languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the team members marked the end of their site visit, Bacow said they had been struck by an e-mail they received from an unnamed Middlebury staff member. Bacow read from the communication to the members of the community gathered in McCullough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is often the sense of place that draws students to us precisely because of where we are and not in spite of it. Middlebury’s connection to the land and how the college is informed by what Vermont itself stands for, both play a significant role in a student’s decision to choose Middlebury. Vermont’s Yankee independent spirit, Vermont’s progressive-not-liberal politics, the care for the environment we all share—all make for a compelling context in which to study and become part of a larger community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mail message continued, &quot;These characteristics speak to the rich context in which the college resides. Not isolated, but rather enriched by our roots here in Vermont and our presence on the international stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacow said the staff member’s poignant comments influenced how the team viewed Middlebury College as an institution and Vermont as a place for learning and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the business of the team’s report, Bacow said a NEASC team’s responsibility is to examine an institution “through the lens of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cihe.neasc.org/standards_policies/standards/standards_html_version&quot;&gt;standards of reaccreditation&lt;/a&gt;.” Accordingly, each member of the visiting team addressed the audience on where Middlebury stood in relation to the 11 pre-established NEASC standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the visiting team’s observations and recommendations will be included in a final report, which will be sent to NEASC and to President Ronald D. Liebowitz. Middlebury will have the opportunity to write a response, and in the spring of 2012 Bacow and President Liebowitz will meet in Bedford, Mass., with NEASC’s Commission on Institutions of Higher Education for a final determination about Middlebury’s accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Liebowitz will make the final report of the visiting team and Middlebury’s response available to the community on the Middlebury website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bacow, the members of team are: Urbain J. DeWinter, associate provost for international programs, Boston University; Andrew B. Evans, vice president for finance and treasurer, Wellesley College; Rena Fraden, dean of faculty and vice president for academic affairs, Trinity College; Benson Lieber, dean of academic support and student research, Amherst College; David L. Smith, John W. Chandler professor of English, Williams College; Kathryn T. Spoehr, professor of cognitive, linguistic, and psychological  sciences, Brown University; and Susan V. Wawrzaszek, associate vice president for library and information services, Wheaton College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Campbell Baldridge, professor of psychology and vice president for planning and assessment, chaired the reaccreditation steering committee at Middlebury. In his remarks, Bacow praised those responsible for organizing Middlebury’s reaccreditation process in general and the site visit in particular, saying he’d done four reaccreditations and that Middlebury’s had run the most smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middlebury’s previous accreditation by NEASC was in 1999. The current reaccreditation process includes the four-year undergraduate college and the degree-granting graduate programs offered by the Language Schools, the Schools Abroad, the Bread Loaf School of English and the Monterey Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>School in Italy celebrates 50th year</title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/290486</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/290485/large/florence_home.jpg&quot; width=&quot;340&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLORENCE, Italy—The 712-year-old Palazzo Vecchio in the center of Florence was the setting for a grand celebration on October 11, as the C.V. Starr-Middlebury School Abroad in Italy marked its 50th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with only 10 students in its first year, the School in Italy now has some 1,400 alumni living all over the world. With sites in Florence, Ferrara and Rome, the school enables students to enroll directly in an Italian university, taking courses in any discipline the university offers. They live with Italian families or roommates and are completely immersed in the Italian language and culture throughout their semester or year abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anniversary celebration was attended by more than a hundred well wishers—alumni of the School in Italy; current students, professors, and staff members; and representatives of Middlebury College. Special guests included the mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi, and Leonardo Ferragamo, CEO of Palazzo Feroni Finanziaria S.p.A, a holding company of the Salvatore Ferragamo shoe and luxury goods dynasty. As president of the Associazione Partners Palazzo Strozzi&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Ferragamo has been instrumental in promoting culture and the arts to the benefit of Florence and those who love the city, while also helping foreign students to participate in the city’s cultural events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width:300px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/view/290527/original/florence_50th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;florence_50th&quot; title=&quot;florence_50th&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Matteo Renzi, mayor of Florence, accepts a Danforth Pewter oil lamp from Rosa Cuda, director of the School in Italy, as a token of Middlebury&#039;s gratitude for the city&#039;s hospitality over the past half-century.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Cason, dean of international programs at Middlebury College, welcomed alumni and guests to the event, and credited the staff and faculty of the School in Italy for the program’s enduring success. “Middlebury’s program in Italy embodies the best of what we want our programs abroad to accomplish,” he said. “It is academically demanding; it exposes students to remarkable new experiences and challenges them to change or reconsider their views of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Geisler, Middlebury’s vice president for Language Schools, Schools Abroad, and graduate programs, reflected on the history of Florence as a center of Italian art, literature and language. “Speaking on behalf of the generations of Middlebury students who have been welcomed here,” he said, “I would like to thank Mayor Renzi and the citizens of Florence for their hospitality and for letting us spend a semester or a year here in the heart of the Western art world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The School in Italy is one of nine C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad. All students at the Schools Abroad are expected to demonstrate a high level of language proficiency and a commitment to language and cultural immersion. During their time abroad, they engage with their host society on a number of different levels, become more proficient in the language, advance their academic and personal interests, and become familiar with the cultural, social, political and historical conditions of their host country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The goal is for colleges and universities to invest a cumulative total of $1 billion in self-managed green revolving funds to finance energy efficiency upgrades on their campuses. The Sustainable Endowments Institute (SEI), which is known for its annual College Sustainability Report Card, is coordinating the challenge along with 13 partner organizations. The challenge’s founding institutions, including Middlebury, have committed to invest a cumulative total of more than $65 million. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middlebury will start its fund, named the Green Revolving Loan Fund, with an initial $300,000 anonymous donation. Ultimately the fund will total $1 million, with the college raising an additional $700,000 from a possible combination of donations, capital budget allocations, and endowment investments. Early in 2012, offices and departments at the college may begin applying for loans for projects that will reduce negative effects on the environment, from energy and water use to greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This initiative makes sense for Middlebury as the college has long been committed to environmental leadership both in terms of academics and operations,” said Middlebury College President Ron Liebowitz. “We especially look forward to class projects that result in applications to the loan fund.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an early participant in the challenge, Middlebury is working with Efficiency Vermont, the energy efficiency utility, and SEI on a pilot program to demonstrate the positive effects of a statewide approach. Three of the initiative’s founding schools — Middlebury, Burlington College and Green Mountain College — are Vermont institutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenge is inspired by the exceptional performance of existing green revolving funds, which have a median annual return on investment of 32 percent, as documented by Greening The Bottom Line, a report published by SEI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bright spot in a rocky economy, these profitable investments are helping create green jobs in campus communities, while lowering operating costs on college and university campuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’re transforming energy efficiency upgrades from perceived expenses to high-return investment opportunities,” said Mark Orlowski, SEI’s executive director. “Middlebury College should be commended for its willingness to invest in energy efficiency improvements on campus.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Green Revolving Loan Fund will reframe our approach to capital-intensive, energy-efficient projects that have longer payback periods,” said Nan Jenks-Jay, Middlebury College dean of environmental affairs. “These critically important improvements will be part of the renovation and construction planning process, and save the college money over time.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEI launched the Billion Dollar Green Challenge today at a conference for the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education in Pittsburgh. With more than 2,500 participants, including representatives of Middlebury College, the conference is the largest gathering to date on higher education sustainability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Middlebury, Harvard, Stanford and ASU, other Founding Circle institutions include Caltech, Dartmouth, George Washington, the University of British Columbia, and Weber State University. (See complete list in the appendix.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several Founding Circle schools have already established funds and are enthusiastic about the benefits. Harvard’s Office for Sustainability Director Heather Henriksen said, “The Green Loan Fund has generated high returns on investment, while improving Harvard’s environmental impact and our bottom line.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guided by a 34-member expert advisory council, the Billion Dollar Green Challenge offers technical assistance, best practices sharing, access to an advanced Web-based tool for managing green revolving funds, peer institutions’ project-specific data and invitations to specialized webinars and conferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Billion Dollar Green Challenge has received financial support from the David Rockefeller Fund, HOK, John Merck Fund, Kresge Foundation, Merck Family Fund, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Roy A. Hunt Foundation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Green Power Partnership, and the Wallace Global Fund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GreenBillion.org&quot;&gt;www.GreenBillion.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cambridge-based nonprofit organization has pioneered research and education to advance sustainability in campus operations and endowment practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPENDIX: Billion Dollar Green Challenge - Founding Circle institutions&lt;br /&gt;Agnes Scott College&lt;br /&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br /&gt;Bellevue College&lt;br /&gt;Berkshire School&lt;br /&gt;Bethany College&lt;br /&gt;Boston University&lt;br /&gt;Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus&lt;br /&gt;Burlington College&lt;br /&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;br /&gt;Daemen College&lt;br /&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;br /&gt;Denison University&lt;br /&gt;Edgewood College&lt;br /&gt; George Washington University&lt;br /&gt; Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br /&gt; Green Mountain College&lt;br /&gt; Hampshire College&lt;br /&gt; Harvard University&lt;br /&gt; Mars Hill College&lt;br /&gt; Middlebury College&lt;br /&gt; Northland College&lt;br /&gt; Oregon State University&lt;br /&gt; St. Lawrence University&lt;br /&gt; Stanford University&lt;br /&gt; Thompson Rivers University&lt;br /&gt; Unity College&lt;br /&gt; University of Arizona&lt;br /&gt; University of British Columbia&lt;br /&gt; University of Minnesota&lt;br /&gt; University of New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt; University of Oregon&lt;br /&gt; Weber State University&lt;br /&gt; Western Michigan University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Solar Decathlon team finishes in fourth place overall</title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/289944</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/289941/large/sd_comms_home.jpg&quot; width=&quot;340&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C.—Middlebury College’s Solar Decathlon team triumphantly climbed the stage for the second straight day during the final awards ceremony for the Department of Energy’s 2011 Solar Decathlon competition on Saturday, Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the communications category the previous day, Middlebury claimed first place in the coveted market appeal category—a victory that ultimately vaulted them to fourth place in the final standings. They moved past competitors Ohio State and Caltech, and wound up just a few points behind third-place finisher Team New Zealand, from Victoria University in Wellington. The winning team was the University of Maryland, and the runner-up was Purdue University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Self-Reliance left the jury very impressed, eclipsing our expectations across the board in livability and marketability,” said Brad Beeson, market appeal juror. “Middlebury College defined its market carefully—a young family of four with a modest income for the region—and demonstrated the fit for that target market with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=gtA04beq12E&quot;&gt;a very  compelling video&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team&#039;s sense of accomplishment grew further when Addison Godine &#039;11, project manager and team founder, received the Best Decathlete Award at Saturday&#039;s ceremony. Godine was recognized for his  active participation in the measured contests, in-depth understanding  of day-to-day team standings, and overall embodiment  of the innovative  spirit of the decathlon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-day competition ended much the way it began—in a chilling wind, under a gunmetal gray sky and clouds that spit rain all day. Indeed, Washington, which hosts the biennial Solar Decathlon, provided little good news, weather-wise, for the 19 teams struggling to remain “net-zero”—to produce as much electricity through their photovoltaic arrays as they consumed in a variety of daily tasks. Self-Reliance, Middlebury’s “new New England farmhouse,” is engineered to perform net-zero on an annual basis, but with just three sunny days in D.C., the team wound up with an eight-kilowatt-hour deficit, costing them 17 precious points. “Two more hours of sun and it would have been second place,” said team member Carson Cornbrooks ’11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width:300px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Take a tour of Self-Reliance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video_filter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video-filter&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/YhGVsyruQYE?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=0&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-yhgvsyruqye&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury celebrated first place in communications on Friday, Sept. 30, a contest that director Richard King called the Solar Decathlon’s most important in his opening remarks. The jury praised the team for conveying “the best of New England’s architecture” and noted that their “holistic approach to communications was refreshing.” Their public tour guides were “passionate and knowledgeable,” their video “absolutely elegant, understated, and educational,” and their website “crisp and embodied with the spirit of the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie Romanov ’11.5, the communications lead for the team who accepted the award, said that even after the house left Middlebury, the team mapped out its floor plan in one of the gyms and practiced leading tours and handling Q&amp;amp;A sessions. “I definitely felt like there was pressure as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; liberal arts school,” she said. “We don’t have technical engineering or architecture programs, but we place a lot of emphasis on writing at Middlebury. If there was anything we were supposed to take on and show the world we could do, it was to communicate really well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the team went to bed in sixth place on Friday night, wondering if it were even possible to still beat out Ohio State and Caltech and make it into the top five in the final standings. On Saturday afternoon, they got their answer. As Wallace Sanders, a Decathlon volunteer counting Self-Reliance’s weekend visitors—2,501 on Saturday alone—put it, “Middlebury just put the sling stone squarely between the eyes of Goliath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width:450px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/view/290089/original/team_photo_comms.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;team_photo_comms&quot; title=&quot;team_photo_comms&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;The Middlebury Solar Decathlon team celebrates a victory in the communications contest on Sept. 30.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are all incredibly excited here in Washington D.C.,” the team wrote on its blog a few minutes after their fourth-place finish was confirmed, “and wish everyone could be here to celebrate with us!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only liberal arts college in the competition, Middlebury had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solardecathlon.gov/scores_teams_middlebury.html&quot;&gt;three outright victories&lt;/a&gt; in the 10 Solar Decathlon contests, with the team and their Self-Reliance, finishing first in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solardecathlon.gov/scores_contests_home_entertainment.html&quot;&gt;home entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to their wins in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solardecathlon.gov/scores_contests_communications.html&quot;&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solardecathlon.gov/scores_contests_market_appeal.html&quot;&gt;market appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashar Nelson, visiting assistant professor of architecture and, along with Andrea Murray, one of Middlebury’s two faculty advisors, stood in the main tent after the closing ceremony, as the crowds filed out and the shock sank in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the beginning,” he said. “It’s the beginning of all these students changing the future. I’m speechless, really.” Emotion caught hold of his voice, and he added, “ ‘Underdogs’ doesn’t begin to describe how we started this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next job for the team: Disassembling Self-Reliance and getting it trucked back to campus, where the building will serve as student housing and an environmental outreach center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was incredible sharing our home with more than 15,000 visitors on the National Mall,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Now it&#039;s time to bring the house home, where it will continue to be an educational tool that demonstrates the livability and affordability of solar-powered homes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Students respond to crisis after Tropical Storm Irene</title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/289894</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/289891/large/together_vermont_t-shirt.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIDDLEBURY, Vt. — After Tropical Storm Irene ripped through Vermont on August 28, student-athletes and coaches from Middlebury College responded with rakes and shovels, bleach and buckets, and countless hours of volunteer labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm that caused record flooding in the Green Mountain State — the worst to hit Vermont since 1927 — destroyed homes and businesses in Hancock, Rochester, Stockbridge, Killington, Brandon and other towns with deep connections to the college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Middlebury’s students were not yet on campus in the days immediately following the storm, so the athletic teams were the first to put their shoulders to the plow to help the college’s neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on behalf of his coaching staff, Erin Quinn ‘86, director of athletics, said, “Middlebury is our town and Vermont is our home. This is where our kids go to school, where we work, where we shop and where there are people we know and care about. We just had to get out there and help. It’s not like a box we check off that says ‘community service.’ This is our home and we had to respond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width:250px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/newsroom/uploads/node/289892/original/x-c_windsor_hurlburts.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;small&quot; src=&quot;/media/view/289892/small/x-c_windsor_hurlburts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;x-c_windsor_hurlburts&quot; title=&quot;x-c_windsor_hurlburts&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Shoveling tons of river mud with the cross-country team in Windsor County&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the town of Middlebury was spared most of the catastrophic damage that made national news for days, Otter Creek in downtown Middlebury was rising so quickly after the tropical storm that something had to be done. So members of the football team dashed from the weight room to fill sandbags and protect businesses along Bakery Lane and homes on Seymour Street near the covered bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-week, Tiffany Nourse Sargent ‘79, director of civic engagement, had organized a command post on campus from which she coordinated the college&#039;s efforts with relief directors from nearby towns, firefighters, local law enforcement officers, representatives from United Way and other charitable organizations, members of the college administration and staff and, of course, the coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things just started organically,” Sargent said, “and it grew from there.” But like others who have worked side-by-side with Tiffany in the past, Quinn and the athletic coaches know that she is a consummate community organizer. The more dire the need, the more determined Sargent gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White River Valley towns on the east side of the Snow Bowl were particularly hard hit, so on Saturday, September 3, the college dispatched members of four fall teams — field hockey, volleyball, cross-country and football — out to pick up debris from fallen trees, shovel out muck from basements, clear paths to people&#039;s homes and help residents sort through their wet belongings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinn and six members of the field hockey team left Middlebury shortly after 6 a.m. and were assigned to help an elderly resident in Hancock whose home was damaged by fire. When the power went out, her electric stove was on. And when the power came back, the stove ignited a fire that damaged her kitchen and two adjacent rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brook next to her house had flooded and the road leading up to it looked like it was in an earthquake,” the athletic director said. With everyone wearing masks and two sets of gloves, the group moved her belongings onto the deck and then bleached, cleaned, rinsed and dried every object before tackling the bigger job of cleaning the walls, floors, countertops and cupboards on the inside of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days and weeks that followed Irene, the women’s tennis team helped displaced homeowners in Stockbridge, men’s soccer players came to the aid of a flooded vegetable grower in New Haven and three teams — men’s and women’s ice hockey plus women’s basketball — cleared debris in agricultural fields in Proctor. And these were just a fraction of the college-sponsored relief efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width:250px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/newsroom/uploads/node/289893/original/tennis_national_guard_1000.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;small&quot; src=&quot;/media/view/289893/small/tennis_national_guard_1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tennis_national_guard_1000&quot; title=&quot;tennis_national_guard_1000&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The women&#039;s tennis team joined the Vermont National Guard to help residents in Stockbridge.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also assisting were athletes and coaches from women’s soccer, men’s rugby, men’s tennis, skiing, softball, swimming, baseball, women’s squash, crew and men’s lacrosse in places near, like East Middlebury, and far, like Windsor on the Connecticut River. Soon others joined in the effort, including Hillel, two OINK (i.e., outdoor adventures for first-year students) trips, the college’s Habitat for Humanity chapter and many individual students. Students from Wonnacott Commons went to Rutland to help the Red Cross break down cots and fold blankets from the temporary shelter there. The president’s office, facilities services, custodial services, Education in Action (EIA), and dining services cooperated in the collegewide effort that is still far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after classes began, a student-directed group called Midd Hurricane Relief formed with Jessica Appelson ’12, Lea Calderon-Guthe ’11.5, Firas Nasr ’15 and Ali Urban ’12 in leadership roles. EIA staff and students quickly designed an “Irene Relief 2011” t-shirt, ordered 500 pieces, and started selling them on campus for $15 with proceeds going toward Vermont Disaster Relief Fund. T-shirts are available at the Middlebury College Bookstore, the box offices in McCullough and Mahaney Center for the Arts, or the arts box office &lt;a href=&quot;http://boxoffice.middlebury.edu/index.php&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; (scroll down to &quot;H&quot; for hurricane.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While appreciation for the efforts of students and staff has been widespread, the work continues. “It’s been nearly four weeks since Irene touched Vermont,” Tiffany Nourse Sargent said, “and the survivors of this terrible event are tired and frustrated and more than a little downhearted. So when they see a carload of college students arriving to help, it lifts their spirits and lightens the atmosphere. It’s just so uplifting to see how we all came together to respond to this crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waters of Vermont’s rivers have receded and most of the state&#039;s roads and bridges have reopened. But what about those sandbags the football team laid along Otter Creek in the first few days after the storm? Not a problem. The track team, coached by Martin Beatty ’84, and men&#039;s lacrosse, coached by Dave Campbell &#039;00, are going to pick them up this weekend while other Middlebury students fan out across the region to help their fellow Vermonters in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks since this story first appeared, Middlebury students have continued to help the residents of communities besieged by Tropical Storm Irene. On the first of October three students devoted the day helping residents of Proctor, Vt., about 25 miles south of Middlebury, where homeowners were still digging out from the flooding of Otter Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend of October 8-9, members of the ski team assisted a Rochester resident whose home and property were ruined by Irene. Seventeen skiers pulled nails out of flooring so the boards could be used in the rebuilding process. They also shoveled thousands of pounds of silt and sand that had washed up onto the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 18 members of the men’s lacrosse team also went to Rochester—one of the communities hardest hit by the tropical storm. After splitting into two units, one group removed mud and equipment from a flooded garage, while the other laid new gravel in a basement that had been flooded. The student-athletes also removed large rocks from the nearby mountain road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of October 10, about half of the 500 “Together Vermont” t-shirts have been sold. The student-organizers of Hurricane Irene Relief are hopeful they will raise more money selling shirts at Fall Family Weekend (Oct. 14-16) and during Homecoming (Oct. 28-30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Middlebury College encourages all members of its community to be familiar with the U.S. Constitution, and has provided this website to make available some library and Internet resources that you may find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Constitution Online site answers both common and obscure constitutional FAQ&#039;s, while the Library of Congress&#039;s American Memory project includes a number of relevant documents and a presentation, &quot;To Form a More Perfect Union: The Work of the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention.&quot; For those interested in the document itself, a digital version of the Constitution is available from the National Archives site. Finally, among the library books listed, you will find Charles A. Dana Professor of Political Science Murray Dry&#039;s 2004 book, &lt;em&gt;Civil Peace and the Quest for Truth: The First Amendment Freedoms in Political Philosophy and American Constitutionalism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>President welcomes Class of 2015 on 10th anniversary of 9/11</title>
 <link>http://www.middlebury.edu/newsroom/archive/2011/node/289169</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-mm-fields-mm-nodelist field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/289167/large/first_years_3404_a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIDDLEBURY, Vt.—President Ronald D. Liebowitz welcomed Middlebury College’s 580 first-year students on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and asserted that their generation is prepared for the challenges of globalization brought on by the events of September 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/president/addresses/archive/convocation_2011&quot;&gt;In his convocation address delivered in Mead Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the president said pre-9/11 generations in the United States grew up in a world influenced by American supremacy, a world shaped first by geography with two great oceans on our shores, and next by unequaled military capacity and missile-defense systems that protected our nation from attack. But that sense of invincibility rendered the U.S. unprepared to deal with a world that had changed dramatically since the 1970s, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is no surprise that basic geographic literacy and foreign-language competency were national weaknesses for decades. There were no tangible or practical reasons for Americans to engage in the world,” he said. But economic reforms in China, European unification and the fall of Soviet communism “created a new world order that provided new liberties and unparalleled prosperity to hundreds of millions of people. But it also unleashed pent-up ethnic and religious hatred that contributed to the rise of radical Islamic fundamentalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since most of the members of the Class of 2015 were 7, 8 or 9 years old on September 11, 2001, President Liebowitz observed, “For you the changes in the American psyche brought on by 9/11 are second nature. They are the norm, what you know. As a result you will elect to study languages … you will engage in outreach projects anywhere in the world … and you will probably work harder and with more focus than most of us ever did to prepare yourselves to compete in labor markets that have become profoundly global.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are in some important ways the antithesis of the pre-9/11 generation,” the president said. For students entering college today, he said there is no more “Pax Americana,” no more world in which the United States can guarantee peace for its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You lack the deep-seated disappointment over current affairs [in Washington] that characterize older generations … your generation has the best chance to identify where and how to find hope and optimism in the coming years … your generation will see the challenges before us for what they are, and not be distracted by how [this country] used to be … and you will be less constrained in finding ways to tackle the tough issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from learning to thrive in a highly globalized society, Middlebury’s 16th president offered this advice: “the day is just 24 hours long” so be sure to leave time for the college’s demanding academic workload; “view your time here as a way to study both broadly and deeply” for that is both “the purpose and advantage” of attending a liberal arts college; resist the notion “that two majors are better than one”; and “find a significant connection here and find it early,” whether to a performing arts group, an athletic team, or any other organization, for it can “provide the kind of social entree that will make your transition here easier and richer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/newsroom/uploads/node/289166/original/marshals_0364_a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;small&quot; src=&quot;/media/view/289166/small/marshals_0364_a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Convocation 2011&quot; title=&quot;marshals_0364_a&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Marshals Hang Du (left) and Stefano Mula&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Middlebury tradition, convocation began outside Mead Chapel with summer still clinging to the Vermont hills. The “first years” (as they are known at Middlebury) lined the walkway from Old Stone Row to the chapel as the faculty, led this year by marshals Hang Du of the Chinese department and Stefano Mula of the Italian department, processed through the gauntlet of new students and into the chapel in their academic robes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students, dressed less formally in floral sundresses and sandals or Oxford shirts and khakis, followed the faculty through the Georgian doors and stood at their pews as Professor Emeritus Emory Fanning played the organ and Chaplain Laurel Macaulay Jordan ’79 delivered the invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provost Alison Byerly, a professor of English and American literatures, discussed the etymology of the word “convocation,” from the Latin &lt;em&gt;convocāre&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to call together,” as a way to welcome the Class of 2015 into their “shared membership” with the faculty in the Middlebury academic community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five heads of Middlebury Commons introduced their students to President Liebowitz and offered a few words about of each of the five commons’ namesakes: Jeremiah Atwater, Middlebury’s first president; Ezra Brainerd, Class of 1864 and a former professor and president; Reginald L. Cook, Class of 1924 and longtime faculty member; Eleanor Ross, Class of 1895 and a former professor and dean of women; and Erica Wonnacott, former dean of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width:250px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/newsroom/uploads/node/289165/original/alma_mater_0410_a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;small&quot; src=&quot;/media/view/289165/small/alma_mater_0410_a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Convocation 2011&quot; title=&quot;alma_mater_0410_a&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First years sing their alma mater for the first time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president introduced the members of the senior class who were elected to the Middlebury chapter of Phi Beta Kappa after their junior years. And Twilight Artist-in-Residence François Clemmons sang a stirring rendition of “This Little Light of Mine” accompanied by Fanning on the piano. The musical arrangement, which is a Clemmons-Fanning collaboration, concluded with the first years clapping and singing along, and earned a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president’s 15-minute address followed, and the significance of his remarks were reflected on the students’ faces as they stood for the benediction given by Associate Chaplain Ira J. Schiffer. Finally, with the singing of the alma mater, Middlebury’s newest crop of students filed out of Mead Chapel and hurried over to Hepburn Hall for their class picture on the hillside.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
